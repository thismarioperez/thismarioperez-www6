# Interactive Learning Platform for Coding

This project is a gamified platform designed for aspiring developers to learn coding interactively. Users progress through a series of challenges, receiving immediate feedback on their code in real-time. Each challenge introduces new concepts while building on previous lessons, creating an immersive and engaging learning journey.

The platform supports multiple languages, including JavaScript, Python, and Ruby, and offers a collaborative mode where users can team up to solve problems. Built with React and TypeScript, the experience is optimized for both beginners and seasoned coders.
