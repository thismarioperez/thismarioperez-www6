# Rodda Construction

### Summary

Lowry Creative undertook the redesign of Rodda Construction's website to better showcase the companyâ€™s portfolio of building projects and provide a centralized feed for press releases and news articles. The project involved creating a custom design that avoided pre-built templates, ensuring a unique and tailored appearance.

### My Role

For the redesign of Rodda Construction's website, I utilized Squarespace's developer mode to bypass the limitations of default CMS blocks. Building custom sliders, content sections, and feeds, I achieved a highly tailored design that aligned with the Art Director's vision. This approach allowed me to deliver a website that exceeded the client's expectations in terms of both functionality and aesthetics.

### Tech Stack
