# 3D Virtual Art Gallery

This interactive 3D web experience invites users to explore a virtual art gallery featuring works from emerging and renowned artists. Using WebGL and Three.js, the platform creates a fully immersive space where users can "walk" through the gallery, zoom in on individual pieces, and read information about the artist and the work itself.

Users can interact with art installations in a way that mimics the real-world gallery experience, complete with customizable lighting and audio effects. The platform also supports virtual exhibitions, where artists can host live walkthroughs of their collections.
