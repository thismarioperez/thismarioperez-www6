# Real-Time Data Visualization Dashboard

This interactive web experience allows users to engage with live data streams, providing real-time insights into key metrics. The dashboard offers customizable visualizations such as graphs, heatmaps, and gauges, which update dynamically as new data comes in.

Users can filter the data by various parameters, zoom into specific time ranges, and compare historical trends. Built with React and WebSockets, the platform ensures a seamless experience, keeping users informed of changes the moment they happen.
