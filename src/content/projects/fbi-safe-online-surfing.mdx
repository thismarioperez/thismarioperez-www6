### Overview

The FBI-SOS (Safe Online Surfing) project is a free, web-based application designed to teach students in grades 3-8 about online safety. Triptych played a key role in bringing the project to life by designing and developing the program's interactive modules and quizzes, ensuring a seamless and engaging user experience. Through their efforts, the program effectively educates children on how to navigate the internet responsibly, avoid cyber threats, and recognize suspicious online behavior, fostering a safer digital environment for young users.

### My Role

For this project I built a modular React component system that could be reused throughout the project for consistency and scalability. I implemented app-wide state management using Zustand to streamline data handling. Working closely with both development and design teams, I helped establish a smooth pipeline for integrating 3D assets into the projec's codebase. Additionally, I set up controls that allowed users to move an avatar around a 3D environment, enhancing interactivity and user engagement.
