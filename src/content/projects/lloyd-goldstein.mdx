### Summary

Lowry Creative designed and developed a website for Lloyd Goldstein, a musician in residence at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, FL. The site features a dedicated blog and an extensive portfolio to highlight Goldstein's rich history of work. The project aimed to provide a comprehensive platform for showcasing his musical achievements and sharing insights through his blog.

### My Role

As the sole front-end developer on this project, I leveraged Squarespace's Developer mode to create a custom template that included features like full-screen video backgrounds, which were not supported by standard Squarespace templates at the time.
